## Methodology

### Strength Scoring
- **Strong:** >80% of factor columns available (well-supported)
- **Moderate:** 40-80% of columns (partial support)
- **Weak:** <40% of columns (high uncertainty)

### Signal Aggregation
1. Count factors by direction (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
2. Weight by strength: Strong=1.0, Moderate=0.5, Weak=0.25
3. Compute weighted ratios
4. Classify as: Strong/Positive, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Strong/Negative

### Important Notes
- **No predictions:** Signals show data patterns only
- **No betting advice:** These are descriptive, not prescriptive
- **Interpretability first:** All signals linked to specific factors
- **Uncertainty tracked:** Weak signals explicitly marked
